# Front End

What frontend does is to equivalently translate SysY source to in-memory IR for further processing
including middle end IR optimization and backend target code generation. Theoretically, it contains lexical
analysis, syntax analysis and (source-IR) translation.

Lexical and syntax analysis are mainly completed with ANTLR supports. A collection of .g4 files under 
[third-party/ANTLR](../../third-party/ANTLR) tell the grammar of SysY, according to which
[SysYLexer](SysYLexer.java), [SysYParser](SysYParser.java), [SysYBaseVisitor](SysYBaseVisitor.java), and
[SysYVisitor](SysYVisitor.java) are automatically generated by ANTLR.

* [SysYLexer](SysYLexer.java), [SysYParser](SysYParser.java) and [SysYBaseVisitor](SysYBaseVisitor.java) are
the ones can be remained unchanged since generated. The former two transcribe the input source into a 
parse tree (ANTLR AST).
* [SysYVisitor](SysYVisitor.java) is the key class performs traversal on the tree and generates IR. 

You can imagine the translation process done by front end as a tiny [Visitor](SysYVisitor.java) traveling
through the parse tree with tools in both hands -- a mini hammer [Builder](IRBuilder.java) and 
a dictionary [Scope](Scope.java), knocking up in-memory IR constructs one by one. 

Finally, [Emitter](IREmitter.java) is the one to emit the in-memory IR in text-based format when needed.
